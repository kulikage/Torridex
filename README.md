**Website:** [Insert your GitHub Pages Link Here]

## About the Project
TorrideX is a DeepTech startup developing a compact, solid-state energy generator based on controlled radioactive decay and plasma physics.

Our mission is to provide autonomous, maintenance-free electricity for extreme environments (Space, Arctic, Deep Ocean) where conventional power sources fail.

## Technology Stack
* **Core:** Solid-state plasma generation via Alpha/Beta decay.
* **Harvesting:** Induction-based current extraction from accelerated plasma flow.
* **Web:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Design), Mobile Responsive.

## Project Status
* [x] Concept Validation
* [x] Web Presence (MVP)
* [ ] Prototype Testing
* [ ] Seed Funding Round

## Legal & Safety
TorrideX operates in strict compliance with IAEA and NRC safety guidelines regarding the handling of radioisotope power systems (RPS).
